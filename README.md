# Docker Field Pack 1.0

## Description
Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. The Docker field pack gathers metrics from the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/) via https.

## APM version
Restful EPAgent 9.7.1.

## Supported third party versions
Tested with Docker version 1.6.1, API version 1.18.

## Limitations
Currently the field pack only queries one docker engine and only works via https. I have tested it only with boot2docker on MacOS.
Recently I had problems with the certificate so I disabled certificate verification.

# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites
* Install, configure and run an EPAgent on the same or a remote server. See [CA APM Environment Performance Agent Implementation Guide](https://wiki.ca.com/display/APMDEVOPS97/CA+APM+Environment+Performance+Agent+Implementation+Guide).

## Dependencies
Pyhton 3 with requests module. This can be obtained in one of the following ways:
      `# yum install python-requests`
                   or
      `# pip install requests`
                   or
      `# easy_install requests`

## Installation
* Extract the zip or tar.gz file.
* Copy docker.typeviewers.xml to your Enterprise Manager (MOM) <EM_HOME>/ext/xmltv.

## Configuration
Nothing else to configure.


# Usage Instructions

## Running the Docker field pack
Run `python3 docker.py` from the command line, e.g.:

`python3 docker.py -p 8080 -d boot2docker -r 2376 --certificate=$DOCKER_CERT_PATH/cert.pem -k $DOCKER_CERT_PATH/key.pem`

Change the parameters to fit your environment. Run the script with option '-h' to get this usage information:

```
Usage: docker.py [options]

Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose         verbose output
    -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                          hostname EPAgent is running on (default: localhost)
    -p PORT, --port=PORT  http port of the EPAgent (introscope.epagent.config.httpServerPort)
    -m METRICPATH, --metric_path=METRICPATH
                          metric path prefix for all metrics
    -d DOCKERHOST, --docker_host=DOCKERHOST
                          docker hostname (default: localhost)
    -r DOCKERPORT, --docker_port=DOCKERPORT
                          docker Remote API port (default: 2376)
    -c CERTFILE, --certificate=CERTFILE
                          https certificate
    -k KEYFILE, --private_key=KEYFILE
                          https private key
```

## Metric description
Metrics are published under the metrics path "Docker". At this level general information about this docker engine is provided:
* Container Count
* Image Count
* Running Containers
* Total Memory
* MemoryLimit (boolean: 0/1)
* SwapLimit (boolean: 0/1)

Container metric for running containers are published under "Docker|Containers|<name>". Container metrics include
* Image name
* SizeRw and SizeRootFS: file system sizes
* Status
* CPU metrics (in Ticks)
* Memory metrics
* Network metrics (receive and transmit)

For more information see [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/).

## Custom Management Modules
None.

## Custom type viewers
The type viewer docker.typeviewers.xml matches metric paths starting with "Docker". Copy it to the `ext/xmltv` folder of your APM Enterprise Manager and restart WebView or log off and back on to your Workstation. There is an overview providing general metrics and a list of containers. You can even see a Java agent monitoring the Tomcat application server running in container b9febdfcdd77:
![Docker overview](Docker-overview.png "Docker overview")

For every container metrics about file system, CPU, memory and network metrics are shown as graphs:
![Docker container metrics](Docker-container.png "Docker container metrics")

## Debugging and Troubleshooting
Your can run docker.py with option -v to provide verbose output. In addition you can remove the '#' in front of several print statements throughput the script.
